# Parity Multisig Recovery Reconciliation

On Jul 18 2017, a black hat hacker exploited a vulnerability in the multisig wallet deployed from the Parity Ethereum node application, and stole
USD 32 million in ethers (ETH) from the funds raised in crowdsales by Aeternity, Edgeless ans Swarm city.

The White Hat Group (WHG) scanned the balances for over 500 multisig wallets using the same vulnerable code, then used the same exploit
to move the ETH and tokens from the wallets into their wallet for safekeeping.

The reconciliation below calculates the ETH and tokens that will be returned to their rightful owners in safer multisig wallets that are
handed back to the original wallet owners.

## Black Hat Hacker
A [bug](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/commit/b640df8fbb964da7538eef268dffc125b081a82f) in the Parity multisig wallet was discovered by a (or a group of) black hat hacker(s).

The hacker executed a transaction calling the `initWallet(address[] _owners, uint256 _required, uint256 _daylimit)` function to gain control of any of these vulnerable multisig accounts - [first hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xff261a49c61861884d0509dac46ed67577a7d48cb73c2f51f149c0bf96b29660).
The hacker could then execute a transaction calling the `execute(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data)` function to transfer out any funds or tokens in the multisig wallet - [first hack tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e0d16475d2ac6a4802437a35a21776e5c9b681a77fef1693b0badbb6afdb083).

The hacker used this exploit to transfer amounts from the following accounts to the hacker(s) account [0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32):

## White Hat Group

The White Hat Group (WHG) found [570 contracts with the same byte code](https://etherscan.io/find-similiar-contracts?a=0xbcb2797f9a74d9099d6077c743feb3bc812eb2a4) and drained about USD 164 million in ETH and tokens using the same exploit as used by the hacker into [0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a).

The first WHG action was in block [4044813](https://etherscan.io/block/4044813) at Jul-19-2017 05:27:10 PM +UTC and the last action was in block [4046151](https://etherscan.io/block/4046151) Jul-20-2017 12:25:26 AM +UTC and here is the balance of the WHG account at 21:20 Jul 20 2017 AEST:

The nonce for the first tx in block 4044813 is 630 and the nonce for the last tx in block 4046151 is 4165. A total of 4615 - 630 + 1 = 3986 transactions were executed by the WHG to rescue the ethers and tokens at risk.

Total gas cost for the last 2,000 transactions is 14.58969814 ETH. Etherscan only exported the last 2,000 transactions for this calculation.

## Reconciliation

I've use the [scripts/getWHGTxs.sh](scripts/getWHGTxs.sh) to extract all transactions moving ETH and tokens from the vulnerable Parity multisig wallets into the WHG's wallet.

**NOTE**

* There is a tx moving 1.9 ETH from the Dao.Casino multisig at 0x01dbb419d66be0d389fab88064493f1d698dc27a where the initiating account was 0x7ec74161ab8b8cb6d2c6ad317d9734a6056b8a52 - https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcd35dd43bba29abd528b25d55f72ac3e4ffd1bdd787ffe956e40347dd948e0d3 . It's not included in my results.

<br />

### Tokens
The WHG token transactions are in [results/tokensRefunds-WHG.tsv](results/tokensRefunds-WHG.tsv).

My token transactions are in [results/tokens.tsv](results/tokens.tsv).

A reconciliation of WHG's and my token transactions shows one small error in line 51 Monaco in the WHG's calculations - see [results/tokensReconcilation.xls](results/tokensReconcilation.xls).

My latest token results for comparison with the WHG rescue data is in [results/multisig_rescue_tokens_bokkypoobah.csv](results/multisig_rescue_tokens_bokkypoobah.csv).

Also note that my .csv file numbers have small rounding issues as I used MS Excel to compute the cumulative amounts. See the .tsv file for the exact amounts in weis.

<br />

### Ethers

My ethers transactions are in [results/ethers.tsv](results/ethers.tsv).

LefterisJP's ethers transactions are in [results/ethers-LefterisJP.csv](results/ethers-LefterisJP.csv) from [https://github.com/LefterisJP/multisigwallet_whitehat_movements_verification/blob/master/multisig_data.csv](https://github.com/LefterisJP/multisigwallet_whitehat_movements_verification/blob/master/multisig_data.csv).

A reconciliation of LefterisJP and my ethers transactions is available in [results/ethersReconciliation.xls](results/ethersReconciliation.xls) and the numbers match exactly.

My latest ethers results for comparison with the WHG rescue data is in [results/multisig_rescue_ether_bokkypoobah.csv](results/multisig_rescue_ether_bokkypoobah.csv).

Note that my ethers data seems to have an incorrect entry when compared to Jordi's data and from manual checking.
The only difference between mine and Jordis ETH data is that I have an extra amount `0x32bacc8b241fb172fee18bda32527126c6f3c5f7 963930173170731000000`.
This transaction was picked up by my script because I looked at each transaction in the blocks containing the rescue transactions, and this
`0x32bacc8b241fb172fee18bda32527126c6f3c5f7` account is not an account that was rescued.

Jordi's file [results/multisig_resque_eth_jordi.csv](results/multisig_resque_eth_jordi.csv) is correct.

Also note that my .csv file numbers have small rounding issues as I used MS Excel to compute the cumulative amounts. See the .tsv file for the exact amounts in weis.

## How Was The Parity Multisig Compromised?

The first attack transaction [0xff261a49](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xff261a49c61861884d0509dac46ed67577a7d48cb73c2f51f149c0bf96b29660) 
was a call to the `initWallet(...)` function with the new owner's address `b3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32` passed and the amount to
be stolen (`new BigNumber("5ac7391989a21040000",16).shift(-18)` = `26793`) as the `_daylimit`parameters:

![](images/AttackTransaction-20170721-130647.png)

After the change in ownership, the hacker sent a [second transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e0d16475d2ac6a4802437a35a21776e5c9b681a77fef1693b0badbb6afdb083) to steal the funds:

![](images/TransferTransaction-20170721-142845.png)

Following is the bit of code with the vulnerability (note the comment "constructor", but this is a regular function):

```javascript
    // constructor - just pass on the owner array to the multiowned and
    // the limit to daylimit
    function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit) {
        initMultiowned(_owners, _required);
        initDaylimit(_daylimit) ;
    }
```

And `initWallet(...)` called the following `initMultiowned(...)` function to change the ownership of the multisig contract:

```javascript
  // constructor is given number of sigs required to do protected "onlymanyowners" transactions
  // as well as the selection of addresses capable of confirming them.
  function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {
    m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;
    m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);
    m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;
    for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i)
    {
      m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);
      m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;
    }
    m_required = _required;
  }
```

This code above was originally the constructor for the Ethereum Wallet multisig wallet contract (below). In Ethereum, the smart contract
constructor code is executed when a contract is deployed to the blockchain, BUT the constructor code is not included in the deployed
Ethereum Virtual Machine code. 

The mistake here was that the constructor was modified to be a regular function (that is included in the
deployed code), and no further checks were placed to restrict the function to only being executable by the existing wallet owner.

Following is the code from the [original Ethereum Wallet multisig](https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/blob/master/wallet/wallet.sol)
called `contract multiowned`, where the constructor has the same name `multiowned(...)`:

```javascript
    // constructor is given number of sigs required to do protected "onlymanyowners" transactions
    // as well as the selection of addresses capable of confirming them.
    function multiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {
        m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;
        m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);
        m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;
        for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i)
        {
            m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);
            m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;
        }
        m_required = _required;
}
```
